## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
<!-- I was confused about hoisting.  How do the variables know to move up before the alert or return statement. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- How does the call and apply function replace the this object? -->
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
<!-- I feel like my progress as a developer is going okay. I am concerned about not being able to pick up writing code as fast as everyone else is.  When I see a blank screen it is hard for me to know where to begin.  I start to get confused, even with breaking it down.  I dont know if i should be practicing more functions or be reading more on the subject.  What I read sometimes does not stick as well as it should be.  -->
